            <h2 class=reed><em>Musician</em></h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've been around music. I can profiently play the drums, the bass, and the guitar, drumming being my favorite of them all. I started when I was 7 years old and ever since had a love for music. My favorite tunes to play are old classic and heavy rock songs from the 60's-90's. I've played live at various venues in LA  with different bands and in company of the school I learned music from: <i>The School of Rock</i></p>
            
            <h2 class="deebo"><em>Independant Artist</em></h2>
            <p>My passion in music grew to a new level by becoming an independent aritist and single-handedily created numerous singles and 2 albums. From experimental music to instrumental beats, I learned how to create, mix, and master songs. I make music on a digital audio workstation called Ableton where I record, sample, and innovate melodies and drumbeats. I have successfully released music on all platforms and has been streamed all over the world.</p>
